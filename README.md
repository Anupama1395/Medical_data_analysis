Medical Dataset Analysis and Exploration
Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis on a medical dataset to understand feature distributions, relationships between variables, and overall data quality before modeling.

The notebook includes structured preprocessing, univariate analysis, and bivariate analysis to prepare the dataset for future machine learning applications.

The goal is to build a strong analytical foundation before applying predictive models.

Objectives

Load and inspect the dataset

Clean and preprocess missing or inconsistent values

Perform univariate analysis on numeric features

Perform categorical feature distribution analysis

Conduct bivariate analysis between selected variables

Identify patterns that may influence model performance

Dataset Description

The dataset contains medical related attributes such as:

Numeric features
Categorical features
Target or outcome variable if applicable

The dataset structure is analyzed using summary statistics and visualization techniques.
